The Answers
 
TV reporter. After Vodafone bought his broadband–ISP startup, Hive, in 2007, he wanted to try something new, so he got a job as a journalist. But it wasn’t for him. “I wanted to be the news instead of reporting it,” he says.
 
The Moogies. It was a total flop. “I was absolutely certain it was such a beautiful, polished title that it would be a best seller instantly,” he says. “I was naive.”
 
The electric bill. Fridriksson sketched out the idea in just one evening. “I wanted a platform where people could meet others combined with a quiz game,” he says. Today, that bill is framed in his Reykjavík, Iceland, office. 
 
Beautiful views. “I’m very anal about this,” he says. “When I was searching for new office space in Reykjavík, we had to have the best view. It has a profound effect on how your brain works.” 

Name the Flag. “It’s a very popular topic, actually,” says Fridriksson. “There are currently 321 levels, so more than 20,000 games have been played—which is just crazy.”
